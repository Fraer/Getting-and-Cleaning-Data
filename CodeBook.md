Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project CodeBook
=================================================
This file contains description of the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were applied on the initial data.

The site where the data was taken: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data required for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The "run_analysis.R" script performs the following steps to transform the data :

 1. Loads feature names from "features.txt" into *featureNames* data.frame

 2. Loads activity indices from "y_train.txt" into *trainActivity* data.frame then loads subject indices from "subject_train.txt" into *trainSubject* data.frame and feature values from "X_train.txt" into *trainFeatures* data.frame with column names taken from the second column of *featureNames*. Then all 3 data.frames are merged into a single data.frame called *trainDf* with cols: Activity, Subject, featureName1, featureName2, ...561  
 
 3. Loads activity indices from "y_test.txt" into *testActivity* data.frame then loads subject indices from "subject_test.txt" into *testSubject* data.frame and feature values from "X_test.txt" into *testFeatures* data.frame with column names taken from the second column of *featureNames*. Then all 3 data.frames are merged into a single data.frame called *testDf* with cols: Activity, Subject, featureName1, featureName2, ...561.
 
 4. The *trainDf* and *testDf* are concatenated into a single data.frame called *fullDf* of dimension 10299*563 that contains all merged data.
 
 5. From *fullDf* all features that corresponds to measurments of "mean" and "standard deviation" are extracted into a separate data.frame called *meanAndStdDf* of dimesion 10299*66. The extraction is performed by selecting columns that contains ".mean." and ".std." since "read.table" function makes the columns R compliant by replacing the following chars in column names: '-', '(', ')' by '.'
 
 6. The indices in "Activity" column of the *meanAndStdDf* data.frame are transformed to factors (loaded from "activity_labels.txt") in order to be descriptive activity names as required by the assignement.
 
 7. In order to appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names the columns of *meanAndStdDf* are transformed such as "mean" becomes "Mean" then "std" becomes "Std" then all dots are removed and the first letter of each column is capitalized.
 
 8. A second independent tidy data set called *finalDf* with the average of each measurement for each of 6 unique activities and each of 30 unique subjects is generated by grouping the data of *meanAndStdDf* data.frame by "Activity" and by "Subject" then applying *mean* function on all columns except "Activity" and "Subject".
 
 9. Then the *finalDf* data.frame of dimension 180*68 is dumped into the "means_per_activity_per_subject.txt" file.
